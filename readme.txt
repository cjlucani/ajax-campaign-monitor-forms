http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/getting-started/

= Is there a shortcode, so I can insert the form into posts or pages? =
Yes, but it's beta - please let me know if it works for you! Just click the CampaignMonitor button in the post/page editor

= What if users don't have Javascript enabled? =
The widget falls back to a standard web page request, but will still keep users on your site, unlike the normal CampaignMonitor forms.
